## IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

## This is an automated Stock Investment App.

### Essentially it is a webapp that will use the Bloomberg Api to find data on a particular company and create predictions on what it's stocks will be the following day and make investments based on that information without user involvement.

### Ideally this would eliminate the need for Hedge funds, which means employees at Hedge funds will be free to pursue something of social value.

## So this is meant to be something that you can invest money into and it will invest it for you, there's a lot of work to do on it though.


#### I will eventually add the ability to predict a company's value based on sentiment using machine learning and the twitter API.
